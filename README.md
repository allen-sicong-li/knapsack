# knapsack

This is a program using dynamic programming to solve the knapsack problem.

The program is built on Xcode.

The raw data is contained in the file named knapsack1.txt. The first column is the weight and the second column is the value.

Since I wrote this code using Xcode so the relative path may not work on your computer.
If you want to build the program on your own computer, please modify the path to make it work.
